    "description": "Share this event everywhere, and invite your friends, your family, and your neighbours. \n Book time off work from April 9th-17th and be ready to continue in civil resistance in London on at least the first 3 weekends following the 17th. \n As our planet passes multiple tipping points and the UK sleepwalks into authoritarianism, what XR does this year affects everything. \n With a simple unstoppable rebellion design we will make space for thousands of new people to join us in April and tip the scales once again towards radical change on the climate and ecological emergency. \n In April, we call on everyone to take action and demand an end to the fossil economy, for the UK government to immediately stop the harm that is happening right now and end fossil fuel investments. We will facilitate a mass flood of people to grind the capital to a halt, causing maximum material disruption and making meeting the immediate demand politically unavoidable. \n Our disruption will not stop until the fossil fuel economy comes to an end. \n Our action will take place under a clear, unified message, inviting everyone to come together under one aligned plan. \n Will you sit back and do nothing? Or will you step up? \n We will rebel until we end the fossil fuel economy. \n We will not be bystanders. \n Let’s step up, April 9th 2022. \n Make a commitment to play your part in April 2022: https://actionnetwork.org/forms/xruk-commitment-2022 \n Rebels are already working hard towards April, donate to support us now: https://chuffed.org/project/xrapril2022 \n Keep up to date with XR’s plans and how to mobilise in your local area: https://extinctionrebellion.uk/join-us/#sign-up-form \n For the most up to date plans, click 'going' on this event and join our telegram broadcast channel: https://t.me/rebellionbroadcast",
